# yolo_V3_open_image_dataset_object_detection
Object Detection Track Object detection is a central task in computer vision, with applications ranging across search, robotics, self-driving cars, and many others. As deep network solutions become deeper and more complex, they are often limited by the amount of training data available.

# Yolov3 Object Detection with Flask and Tensorflow 2.0 (APIs and Detections)
Yolov3 is an algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detection. This repository implements Yolov3 using TensorFlow 2.0 and creates two easy-to-use APIs that you can integrate into web or mobile applications. <br>

### Saving your yolov3 weights as a TensorFlow model.
Load the weights using `load_weights.py` script. This will convert the yolov3 weights into TensorFlow .ckpt model files!

```
# yolov3
python load_weights.py

```

### Usage examples
Let's run an example or two using sample images found within the data/images folder. 
```bash
# yolov3
python detect.py --images "data/images/dog.jpg, data/images/office.jpg"

# yolov3-tiny
python detect.py --weights ./weights/yolov3-tiny.tf --tiny --images "data/images/dog.jpg"

# webcam
python detect_video.py --video 0

# video file
python detect_video.py --video data/video/paris.mp4 --weights ./weights/yolov3-tiny.tf --tiny

# video file with output saved (can save webcam like this too)
python detect_video.py --video path_to_file.mp4 --output ./detections/output.avi
```
